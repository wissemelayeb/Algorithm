This code prompts the user to enter a sentence, reads the input, and then analyzes the sentence to determine its length, word count, and vowel count.
It accomplishes this by iterating over each character in the sentence using a for loop. 
During each iteration, the code checks if the character is a space, in which case it increments the word count, or if it is a vowel, in which case it increments the vowel count.
After the loop completes, the code outputs the length of the sentence, the number of words in the sentence, and the number of vowels in the sentence.
